Created by unsignedzero and vaibhav-y on 12-24-2013 as an idea.

* This is the lazy man's alternative to visiting the website itself:
* This script fetches pdfs for a particular course from [Tutorials Point](www.tutorialspoint.com) and has been written solely for educational purposes
* Surprise: Tutorialspoint already provides pdfs (in the near future)
